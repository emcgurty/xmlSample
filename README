I wanted to see how difficult it was to build a ROR application that gathered 
data initially from an XML file and thereafter the user interacted with a hash.
Toward this task I used REXML and Builder with XMLMarkup.  

I didn't want to cache the data per se.

params allowed rebuild of the known data without returning to the XML file and some 
fancy foot-work in my html (hidden or inline divs) to preserve/capture hash values

Through some calls to perhaps serialization I wasn't successful in eliminating database.yml, 
a bogus model and the gemfile setting for mysql2

Incorporated some Jquery in this application. In asset\javascripts I placed the following jquery file:
